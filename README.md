This repository includes code for the manuscript "Spatial connectivity increases ecosystem resilience towards an ongoing regime shift".

The main script is called "sticklebackMAIN" and this one calls various help scripts from the folder "help_scripts".

A large part of the code consists of processing and extracting environmental data from various sources. As there are restrictions on our ability to share some of the underlying environmental data, we only share the final data frame with the extracted data that are used to produce the presented results ("sub_df.csv"). We still include the code for the data processing and connectivity calculations so that all analytical choices can be evaluated in detail (but this code cannot actually be run as the underlying datasets are not freely available).

We are happy to discuss requests for the underlying environmental datasets, and happy to share these when we are able to do so.
